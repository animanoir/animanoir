I´m a software developer specialized in (front)web development. I´ve been working with **React** for the past 3 years.

##### My current interests are:

- 3D in web with **Three.js**
- Blockchain (mainly with Ethereum)
- Computer philosophy
- Learning every nook & cranny of computer science and programming languages, so I´m open to learn anything I found useful or interesting.
- Being creative and imaginative.
